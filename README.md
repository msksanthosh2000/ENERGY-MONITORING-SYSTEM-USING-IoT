# ENERGY-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-IoT

## ABSRACT of Project:
            Conventional electric meters do not provide information regarding power consumption at device level. Due to which consumers cannot monitors the electricity consumption of each appliances. We intend to implement an energy monitoring  system through which the consumer can be equipped with the information about energy expenditure of individual electrical appliances. With the information available at device level users can effectively manage their energy consumption and also detect and replace faulty and energy intensive appliances with their energy efficient counter parts. The proposed IOT enabled smart energy meters will helps consumers in obtaining energy consumption information assist in ensuring the devices function as per expected energy expenditure pattern. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
            Conventional electric meters measures the power consumption of the whole residence or the industry on a monthly basis, consumers have no means to monitor the power consumption of individual appliances. Due to lack of communication facilities in the meters consumers cannot access or lock the energy consumption. Consumers are unaware of their daily behaviours with respect to energy consumption and also lack of awareness regarding the operation behaviour of the electrical appliances.

## LIMITATIONS :
            -Consumer has to anticipate the monthly electricity bill. 
            -The process of meter reading is manual and tedious. Meter readings are often not accurate. 
            -Development of meter software applications and  supportive network infrastructure is complicated and    often invasive. 
            -Consumption data on device-level is lacking.
            -Lack of communication facility in the meters.
## OBJECTIVE :
            -To develop a plug-in and use device which can be easily incorporated in any household or industry.
            -Provide an objective and accurate measure of the energy consumed by individual devices. 
            -Provide remote monitoring of the energy consumption over the Internet. 
            -Provide an affordable, efficient solution towards making consumers aware about their electrical expenditure behavior and thereby, encourage conscious conservation of energy.

## PROPOSED SYSTEM:
            We proposed to design a system that can be used easily with any electrical appliances without the need for complex rewiring thereby assuring affordability and easy to access consumption information. The system is built using Arduino UNO  with ESP8266 onboard wifi module along with current sensor. The system will not impact the working of device whose consumption is being measured. Using a ThingSpeak channel information  can be easily accessed, visualized and monitored.
