# ENERGY-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-IoT


Main purpose ot this project to design a system that can be used easily with any electrical appliances without the need for complex rewiring thereby assuring affordability and easy to access consumption information. The system is built using Arduino UNO  with ESP8266 onboard wifi module along with current sensor. The system will not impact the working of device whose consumption is being measured. Using a ThingSpeak channel information  can be easily accessed, visualized and monitored.
